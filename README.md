# NYC Farmers Markets
A Ruby Gem with CLI for the [NYC Farmers Markets API](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cityofnewyork.us/cw3p-q2v6).
Check out the [RubyGems page](https://rubygems.org/gems/nyc-farmers-markets) for this gem.

## Install Using RubyGems
```
gem install nyc-farmers-markets
```


## Build and Install from Source
Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/HarlemSquirrel/nyc-farmers-markets-cli-gem.git
```
Build the gem
```
cd nyc-garmers-markets-cli-gem
gem build nyc-farmers-markets.gemspec
```
Install the gem

gem install ./nyc-farmers-markets-*.gem
```


## Incorporating in your own app
Require the library
```ruby
require 'nyc_farmers_markets'
```

Fetch the markets.
```ruby
markets = NYCFarmersMarkets::GetMarkets.new.make_markets
```

This will give you an array of `Market` objects. Each market has seven attributes: `additional_info`, `borough`, `name`, `state`, `street_address`, `website`, and `zip_code`. Some data may be incomplete from the API. You can access these like this:
```ruby
markets[0].name # => "Riverdale Youthmarket"
markets[0].website # => "http://www.grownyc.org/youthmarket"
```

There are a few useful class methods as well.
```ruby
NYCFarmersMarkets::Market.find_by_borough(b)
NYCFarmersMarkets::Market.find_by_zip_code(z)
NYCFarmersMarkets::Market.list_boroughs
NYCFarmersMarkets::Market.list_zip_codes
NYCFarmersMarkets::Market.num_markets_in_borough(b)
```


## Command-Line Interface
This gem will give you the `nyc-farmers-markets` executable that you can run in your terminal.
```
